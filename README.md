# Modularino
Modularino is a whole system composed of multiple PCBs: there's the motherboard wich has the necessary components to connect all the modules and the connectors to plug in the modules. there are two types of modules: MPU and USB:



MPU: they have a total of 5 mezzanine connector so you can choose your mpu module and simply snap it on top of the motherboard, you can choose the module based on your necessity, if you need a wifi feature to your project you just snap on the ESP module and so on...


USB: you can choose what usb connector to use on your board based on the cable you have or the usb type you like more, so you don't need to find the specific cable for your board. For example is so annoying when you have your arduino nano wich needs a usb mini B connector and you can't find the cable, with modularino you can choose what usb port to use!


Modularino motherboard works as a development board so you have all the GPIO connectors and others to make your best electronics projects!



By using the mezzanine connectors for connecting the modules to the motherboard you can save up a lot of space and money since it's one of the cheapest type of connectors with great mechanical characteristics



To summarize: Modularino is a base board with all the breakout GPIO pins where you can attach all the sensors, actuators ecc for your project like an arduino or a raspberry board, the diffrence is that it hasn't a microcontroller installed but you can choose the microcontroller module and snap it on top of the motherboard based on your necessity, same thing fo usb ports, modularino doesn't have the usb port already installed but you get to choose wich port to install by snapping on top the corresponding usb module.
